Watch for Northern Lights Tonight
(CANADA, March 21,1989)
Today is the first day of spring around the world. Today is special for one other reason. If you look at the sky tonight, you may see the northern lights.
For years, no one knew what caused these lights. Now we know that the sun's light is the cause. It gives electric power to specks of dust. Then these specks reach the air high above the earth. They give off strange colors.
You must live far north to see the northern lights. Most of the time, you can only see them at the start of spring or in the fall.
The lights take many shapes. The ones most often seen are streaks or rays of color. They seem to reach hundreds of miles into the sky. The colors may be yellow-green, purple, or red.
This light show may be better than the Fourth of July!
